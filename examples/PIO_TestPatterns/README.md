# Test Patterns

Simple solid colors, gradients and test line patterns, could be used to test matrixes for proper operation, flickering and estimate fillrate timings.

Should be build and uploaded as a [platformio](https://platformio.org/) project


To build with Arduino's framework use
```
pio run -t upload
```

To build using ESP32 IDF with arduino's component use
```
pio run -t upload -e idfarduino
```
